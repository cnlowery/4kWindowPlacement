# 4kWindowPlacement
Autohotkey script to arrange windows on a single 4k monitor with keyboard shortcuts

Setup:<br>
Install autohotkey<br>
Save .ahk to computer<br>
Right click on .ahk and run with autohotkey<br>

Shortcuts:<br>
Win+Numpad(1-3) sets lower half thirds<br>
Win+Numpad(4-6) sets full height thirds<br>
Win+Numpad(7-9) sets upper half thirds

CTRL+Numpad(1-9) sets a slightly larger window right in the middle (5) and smaller windows around it

CTRL+Win/Alt+Numpad(2,4,5,6,8) aligns the left/right third(ish) sections with tall skinny thirds and top and bottom banners<br>
this arrangement was made specifically for Visual Studio toolbar management
